## DjangoHelloWorld
A simple Python Django project that prints Hello, World on browser. Just for practice!

# To run this project:
1. Make sure you have Python and Django installed on your computer. If not, ask a grown-up to help you install them.
2. Open your command prompt or terminal.
3. Go to the folder where you saved this project using the `cd` command. For example, if the project is in a folder called "myproject", type `cd myproject`.
4. Once you're in the project folder, type `python3 manage.py runserver` and press Enter. This will start the server.
5. Now, open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Ta-da! You should see a "Hello, World!" message on the page.

To stop the server:
- Press CONTROL-C in your command prompt or terminal.

That's it! Have fun exploring Django and making cool web apps! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
